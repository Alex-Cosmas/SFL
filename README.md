How to clone and run the application.

First, install your node dependencies using

```
yarn

 # or

npm install.
```

Secondly, run the development server using:

```
npm run dev

# or

yarn dev

```

**My Process.**

I first sketched a simple flowchart and a site map with pen and paper.

I later translated the flowchart to low fidelity wireframes with Invision Freehand.

Used Figma to create a functional prototype.

Translated the designs into code using NextJs & TailwindCSS.

For state management between the components, I used Xstate.

**Considerations**

What is tomorrow a new feature is required or need to be disabled? How easy will it be to add or remove?

Will the app crash because a feature was removed and how easy will it be add new things to the app without having it crash.

**Choice of layout.**

I went for the stacked layout because I could easily extend the application as per need without going back or rebuilding the entire app.

**Efficiency**.

Ability to build reusable components which allows making designs easy and specific through layouts.

Below is a a link and an image of the wireframes for my solution.

Process
UX Design Decisions

1. Create a Flow Chart to understand the required components.
2. Design a low fidelity wireframe and know which components to build.
3. Finding the right UX copy based on the layout choice. I went with the stacked layout due to
   - Ease of extending a design system without forcing things + having a house of cards.
   - Efficient building of reusable components and layouts for the entire application
   - Scale management. If the application grows and there are future features to the added. We will not have a house of cards situation.
